# VibMusic

Vib'Music is an iOS application that changes automatically the brightness of your HomeKit Lightbulbs depending on the sound amplitude captured by the microphone of your iPhone.

Vib'Music offers you:
- Full management of your HomeKit (homes/rooms and lightbulbs accessories) with the possibility to save which room or lightbulb(s) you want to be active.
- Full management (CRUD) of custom ambiances to change the color (based on HUE/Brightness/Saturation) of the actives lightbulbs/rooms.
- WatchOS application (linked to the iOS app) which allows you to easily change the ambiance of the actives lightbulbs/rooms from your Apple Watch.
